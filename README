# Encrypted Static Site

Did some Wedding Photography for a friend, wanted a quick way to host though netlify so...

so providing FILES_PASS environment variable is provided then...

then the
  - encrypt.bash script will encrypt the local static site - use after working on the site.
  - decrypt.bash script will decrypt the static site, either to work on after cloning, or to publish the site via tools like netlify


Although I wont provide the password to the static site in this case, feel free to fork and use for yourself.
happy to accept PR's however do not push changes to the file: files.tar.gz.gpg

Regards
Alistair
